# Linear Regression – Salary Prediction

This project predicts employee salary based on years of experience using a Linear Regression model.

## Project Description
Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict continuous values.
In this project, salary is predicted using years of experience as the input feature.

## Folder Structure
- dataset/ → Contains the CSV dataset
- notebook/ → Jupyter notebook for data analysis and model training
- model/ → Trained model saved as .pkl file
- streamlit_app/ → Streamlit web application

## Dataset
- salary.csv
- Columns:
  - YearsExperience
  - Salary

## Algorithm Used
- Linear Regression

## Model Saving
The trained model is saved using Pickle format (.pkl) for reuse and deployment.

## Web App
A Streamlit web application is created to predict salary by entering years of experience.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## Output
The application predicts salary based on user input in real time.

## Internship Task
This project is completed as part of my Machine Learning Internship.
