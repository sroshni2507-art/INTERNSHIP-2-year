# Linear Regression – House Energy Consumption Prediction

This project predicts house energy consumption using a Linear Regression model based on various input features.

## Project Description
Energy consumption prediction helps in understanding power usage patterns in houses.
Linear Regression is used to predict continuous energy values based on house-related features.

## Folder Structure
- dataset/ → Contains house energy dataset
- notebook/ → Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing and model training
- model/ → Trained Linear Regression model saved as .pkl file
- streamlit_app/ → Streamlit web application for prediction

## Dataset
- house_energy.csv
- Example features:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - WindSpeed
  - EnergyConsumption (target)

## Algorithm Used
- Linear Regression

## Model Saving
The trained model is saved as a `.pkl` file using the pickle library.

## Web Application
A Streamlit web app is developed to predict house energy consumption by entering feature values.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## Output
The model predicts energy consumption based on user inputs.

## Internship Task
This project is developed as part of my Machine Learning Internship.
